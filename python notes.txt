DAY 9: PYTHON FILE HANDLING:

COMMANDS:
- file = open('filename.txt', 'mode')
      filename.txt: name (or path) of the file to be opened.
      mode: mode in which you want to open the file (read, write, append, etc.)
Note:  If you don’t specify the mode, Python uses 'r' (read mode) by default.
       If the file exists, it returns a file object connected to that file; if the file does not exist, Python raises a FileNotFoundError.

- The file.close() method closes the file and releases the system resources. If the file was opened in write or append mode, closing ensures that all changes are properly saved.

f = open("geek.txt", "r")
print("Filename:", f.name)/s
print("Mode:", f.mode)
print("Is Closed?", f.closed)

f.close()
print("Is Closed?", f.closed)


Mode	Meaning	Description
'r'	Read	Opens file for reading (error if file doesn’t exist)
'w'	Write	Opens file for writing (creates a new file or overwrites existing)
'a'	Append	Opens file for writing (adds data to the end of file)
'x'	Create	Creates a new file (error if file already exists)
'r+'	Read + Write	Opens file for both reading and writing
'w+'	Write + Read	Overwrites existing file, allows reading
'a+'	Append + Read	Opens for reading & appending
'b'	Binary mode	Used for binary files (e.g., images, PDFs)
't'	Text mode	Default mode for text files


Method	Description	Example
.read(size)	Reads entire file or given number of characters	f.read(10)
.readline()	Reads one line from the file	f.readline()
.readlines()	Reads all lines into a list	lines = f.readlines()

Method	Description	Example
.write(string)	Writes a string	f.write("Hello")
.writelines(list)	Writes a list of strings	f.writelines(["A\n", "B\n", "C\n"])

.seek(offset)	Move cursor to position (in bytes)	f.seek(0)
.tell()	Return current position of cursor	f.tell()

.name	Name of the file	'demo.txt'
.mode	Mode used to open file	'r'
.closed	True if closed	True or False



file = open("newfile.txt", "w")  # creates file if it doesn't exist
file.write("This is my first file!\n")
file.close()



lines=["- Let's all cheer and celebrate the great festival of diwali. \n", "- I just love it\n", "- The festival brings us joy and blessing god in our lives and helps us get ahead in life."]
file = open("newfile.txt", "w")
file.write("- Python is the best language in th world. \n")
file.writelines(lines)
file.close()

file=open("newfile.txt","r")
content=file.readlines()
for line in content:
    print(line)
file.close()

with open("newfile.txt", "r") as f:
    for line in f:
        print(line.strip())


with open("newfile.txt", "r") as f:
    print(f.read(10))
    print("Current position:", f.tell())
    f.seek(0)
    print("After seek:", f.read(5))


Writing a CSV file manually using file handling

data = [
    "Name,Age,Grade\n",
    "Alice,20,A\n",
    "Bob,22,B\n",
    "Charlie,19,A\n"
]

with open("students.csv", "w") as file:
    file.writelines(data)

print("CSV file created successfully!")
with open("students.csv","r") as f:
    content=f.readlines()
    for line in content:
        # print(line)
        row = line.strip().split(",")
        print(row)
import csv

data = [
    {"Name": "John", "Age": 20, "Grade": "A"},
    {"Name": "Mary", "Age": 22, "Grade": "B"},
    {"Name": "Steve", "Age": 19, "Grade": "A"},
]

with open("students.csv", "a", newline="") as file:
    fieldnames = ["Name", "Age", "Grade"]
    writer = csv.DictWriter(file, fieldnames=fieldnames)

    writer.writeheader()   # Write the column names
    writer.writerows(data) # Write all rows

line=["- I am sannith\n", "- I am a data scientist \n"]
file = open("sannith.txt", "w")
file.write("thisi is a good day")
file.write("\n - this is anothe day at the office")
file.writelines(line)
file.close()
file.write("THID II GMB MBODB")
